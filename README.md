# Note-Taker-Express-JSON

## Description
My motivation for creating this application was to create a note taking application that can be used to create notes, add them to a directory of notes, and give the user the ability to delete the notes if they chose to do so. I built this project because creating lists by hand is tedious and is a lot easier to do when done through an application that can save, store, and delete the notes. This solves the problem of having a "Notes" app similar to the one found on the iPhone, but on your PC. You don't always have your phone on you and it's possible it gets lost. This application offers a note taking advantange that can be accessed from any PC. It's also a lot faster to utilize this application to create lists over simple pen or pencil. From building this project, I learned the advantanges of Express, such as static file saving, and how important and powerful the backend of applications are.

## Installation
To get the application running on your local machine, you need to run the following commands in your terminal, in the project directory:

1) 'npm install'
2) 'npm start'

The first command `npm install` is necessary to install all the project dependencies, including Express.js. The second command `npm start` will start the server and you can then access the application at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

Once the application has been accessed and started (by clicking the "Get Started" button), the application should look like the following screenshot:

To add a note, click the '+' symbol in the upper right-hand corner. Once you have clicked the '+' button, the application will ask for a title for the notes. After a title has been added, the notes content can then be filled in. After you have entered in all the content for that note, click the save icon in the upper right-hand corner, as shown in the following screenshot:

The note has now been saved! If you need to delete a note, click the red trashcan icon next to the titled note as shown in this screenshot:
