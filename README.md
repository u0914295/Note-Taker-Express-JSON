# Note-Taker-Express-JSON

## Description
My motivation for creating this application was to create a note taking application that can be used to create notes, add them to a directory of notes, and give the user the ability to delete the notes if they chose to do so. I built this project because creating lists by hand is tedious and is a lot easier to do when done through an application that can save, store, and delete the notes. This solves the problem of having a "Notes" app similar to the one found on the iPhone, but on your PC. You don't always have your phone on you and it's possible it gets lost. This application offers a note taking advantange that can be accessed from any PC. It's also a lot faster to utilize this application to create lists over simple pen or pencil. From building this project, I learned the advantanges of Express, such as static file saving, and how important and powerful the backend of applications are.

## Installation
To get the application running on your local machine, you need to run the following commands in your terminal, in the project directory:

npm install
npm start

The first command `npm install` is necessary to install all the project dependencies, including Express.js. The second command `npm start` will start the server and you can then access the application at http://localhost:3000.
